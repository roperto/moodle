If you've included questions with feedback (such as the comment question), then you might want to review your students' feedback before releasing it. These switches allow you to do just that.

Setting the switch to the red cross rescinds feedback. You can rescind at the group level, the user level, the question level, or individual comments. Basically, if you see something inappropriate, set the switch to red.

If you're using automatic mark release (the default), comments are approved by default: setting the switches to green has no effect, other than indicating to other staff that you've approved this comment. If you're using manual release, the switches control mark release. When each feedback <em>about</em> a user has had its switch set to green, then that user's marks will be released.
