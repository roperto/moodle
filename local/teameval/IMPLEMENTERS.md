# Implementing Team Evaluation in your plugin

## Implement your evaluation_context subclass

You need to implement six methods from evaluation_context.

### evaluation_permitted

When called with null, return true if team evaluation makes sense in this context. For example, if your module is not set to group mode, you should return false.

When called with a userid, return true if that user should be shown the evaluation block. This might only make sense after they have submitted work, or otherwise completed some portion of your activity.

### user_group

Return the group that represents the user's team. Every user who can evaluate should belong to exactly one group. This should return a group object returned from Moodle's Groups API.

### all_groups

Every group that could potentially be returned by user_group. This should return an array of group objects returned from Moodle's Groups API, keyed by group ID.

### marking_users

Return a list of every user who has permission to mark in this activity. These are the users who can be passed to user_group and evaluation_permitted. Return a list of user objects from Moodle's User API.

### grade_for_group

The idea of team evaluation is to take a single group grade and adjust it according to each team member's contributions to the group. This function returns that initial group grade, from 0-100 as per Moodle standards.

### trigger_grade_update

Sometimes, changing team evaluation settings will change the final grades of your activity. In this case, we need you to go through your normal process to determine grades and send them to the gradebook. Remember that at some point during this process, you will need to call the adjust_grades method on your evaluation_context - that will return the grades adjusted according to teameval scores. You will almost always call this during YOURMODULE_update_grades.

There are optionally some more methods you could implement.

### __construct

Technically, you don't need to override this method; you can just call it with the cm_info for your module. However, it will probably make your life a lot easier to override it and store some more context data. For example, if your plugin is encapsulated in a class, storing the instance of it will probably make your life a lot easier.

### plugin_namespace

When we need to scope things according to your plugin, we use this function. Normally it just returns the top-level namespace of the calling class, but if you're using teameval in a subplugin, or if your evaluation_context is defined in the global namespace, you should override this with a unique namespace for your plugin. (The namespace convention for moodle is plugintype_pluginname, like mod_assign or block_messages).

### component_string

Occasionally we might need to ask you for the human-readable name of your plugin. The default implementation gets the `modulenameplural` string if you're an activity module, or `pluginname` if you're any other kind of plugin.

### questionnaire_locked_hint

The questionnaire is locked to editing when evaluation_permitted returns true for at least one person in marking_users. We give the user a hint on how to unlock the questionnaire, if they need to. This function should return a localised string with that hint.

### format_feedback

Teammate feedback is appended to your plugin's feedback in the gradebook. If you want to customise how that looks, implement this function.

### format_grade

Grades aren't always out of 100. Use this function to format your grades according to your plugin's normal presentation. The default implementation simply rounds to the grade item's decimals value. You can return any value coercable to string.

## Implement _get_evaluation_context

More or less all this function needs to do is instantiate your evaluation context and return it. It should live in your lib.php and be named (like the other global plugin functions) YOURMODULE_get_evaluation_context, and take a single argument of a cm_info object.

You can cache this if your object is heavy to create.

## Calling update_grades

When your users have evaluated each other, you can submit adjusted grades to the gradebook. **Note that your plugin is still responsible for submitting grades to the gradebook** - there's no Moodle plugin that can intercept grades. Much as your evaluation_context is teameval's view in to your plugin, it's also your view into teameval. You should call update_grades with an array of gradebook grades keyed by user id. You usually want to call this in your plugin's YOURMODULE_update_grades function in lib.php. This function doesn't modify the grades in place - you have to take the returned array. If evaluation isn't permitted or enabled in your activity, update_grades will return the passed array directly.

Whenever you call into a teameval function, you should first check if the plugin is installed. You can do that with the following code:

    $teameval_plugin = core_plugin_manager::instance()->get_plugin_info('local_teameval');
    if ($teameval_plugin) {
    	// teameval is installed
    }

So your update code should look like

    $teameval_plugin = core_plugin_manager::instance()->get_plugin_info('local_teameval');
    if ($teameval_plugin) {
        $evaluationcontext = \local_teameval\evaluation_context::context_for_module($workshep->cm);
        $grades = $evaluationcontext->update_grades($grades);
    }

### Presenting the block

You've implemented the necessary code â€“ now it's time to actually show your users the team evaluation UI.

Like before, we need to guard that the plugin is installed. Aside from that, it's just a case of fetching the renderer, creating the block, and rendering the result.

    $teameval_plugin = core_plugin_manager::instance()->get_plugin_info('local_teameval');
    if ($teameval_plugin) {
        $teameval_renderer = $PAGE->get_renderer('local_teameval');
        $teameval = \local_teameval\output\team_evaluation_block::from_cmid($cm->id);
        echo $teameval_renderer->render($teameval);
    }

That's it! Teameval handles all the UI from there.

## Implement reset methods

There's one last thing to do, and it's all about course reset. There's three methods that are called on your plugin when the course is reset: YOURMODULE_reset_course_form_definition, YOURMODULE_reset_course_form_defaults, and finally YOURMODULE_reset_userdata. For each of these there's a corresponding evaluation_context method.

Unlike previous calls where you would call a convenience method to get your evaluation_context, these first two methods require you to directly call on to your evaluation_context subclass. That's because they're declared static; we're talking about the plugin generally, not a specific course module. So, in your reset_course_form_definition function, you should call ::reset_course_form_definition on *your evaluation_context subclass*.

So if you've declared your evaluation_context subclass in the modern Moodle namespace format in your module's classes directory, it would look like

    function YOURMODULE_reset_course_form_definition($mform) {

        // your form definition goes here...

        $teameval_plugin = core_plugin_manager::instance()->get_plugin_info('local_teameval');
        if ($teameval_plugin) {
            \mod_YOURMODULE\evaluation_context::reset_course_form_definition($mform);
        }

    }

    function YOURMODULE_reset_course_form_defaults($course) {

        $defaults = array();

        // set your form defaults here...

        $teameval_plugin = core_plugin_manager::instance()->get_plugin_info('local_teameval');
        if ($teameval_plugin) {
            \mod_YOURMODULE\evaluation_context::reset_course_form_defaults($mform);
        }

    }

The actual reset is a little more complicated, and will likely be tailored to your specific module. But unlike before, when you call reset, you're resetting the data for a specific module, so it's declared as a normal method on evaluation_context. That means you can use YOURMODULE_get_evaluation_context, but if you've already spun up an instance of your module, it might be faster to call your evaluation_context's constructor directly. That's something you will have to decide for yourself; for simplicity, we're going to call get_evaluation_context in this example.

Probably somewhere in your reset function is a loop over all the modules in your course; you should call reset_userdata at the end of each iteration.

    function YOURMODULE_reset_userdata($data) {

        // your reset function goes here

        foreach($module in $modules) {

            // code goes here to reset the module

            // assuming you store a cm_info object somewhere in your module class
            $evalcontext = YOURMODULE_get_evaluation_context($module->cm);
            $evalcontext->reset_userdata($data);

        }

    }

## Test your implementation

At this point you want to go through each of your module's user stories and make sure that team evaluation is working as expected. If your Moodle is in developer mode (i.e. debug is set to E_ALL | E_STRICT and debugdisplay is on) then you'll get a handy "Randomise" button at the bottom of each evaluation form; this will insert random values into each question. It can also leave some questions incomplete, if you want to test that path as well.

## You're done!
