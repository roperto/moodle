    These next two things are templatables, not renderables. There is a good reason for
    this! Simply put, these are virtually always rendered client-side, via a webservice.
    Teameval can't guarantee that your custom rendering code will run, and indeed it
    almost always won't be. If you need to run code in your view that can't be handled
    by Mustache, include it as Javascript in a {{#js}}{{/js}} block and it will be run
    every time your view is rendered.

    Keep that in mind - it will be run EVERY TIME YOUR VIEW IS RENDERED. Be performant,
    and make sure not to install event handlers twice. Strongly consider using AMD so that
    your code is cached.
